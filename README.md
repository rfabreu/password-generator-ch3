# Password Generator

## Project

This project was developed as part of the module challenge activity.
The proposal is to use JavaScript create a functional password generator, that prompts the user to pick certain criterias to create the new password.

<br/>

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

<br/>

## Use

    -   When user clicks the button it will be prompted to specify the following criterias:
        •   Password length;
        •   Yes or No for lowercase characters;
        •   Yes or No for uppercase characters;
        •   Yes or No for numbers;
        •   Yes or No for special characters;

    –   It will then return the password result based on the criteria chosen by the user.
